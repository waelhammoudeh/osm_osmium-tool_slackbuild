README_REPO

Osmium is a multipurpose command line tool for working with OpenStreetMap
data based on the Osmium library.

This repository has Slackware build scripts for the osmium tool.
 It includes the following three (3) directories:

1) protozero-slackbuild
2) libosmium-slackbuild
3) osmium-slackbuild

There is also a fourth directory named "sources-used". 
Note that I can not re / distribute sources. This directory is ignored by git.

See the README file in each directory please.
