The Osmium-tool

This is the README file for osmium-tool slackware build script.

Osmium is a command line tool for working with OpenStreetMap data files.

Required Packages:
1) Provided by slackware64 current (mine was last updated Nov.2nd/2020):
    - boost
    - bz2lib
    - zLib
    - cmake
    - expat
  
2) Found on SlackBuild.org server: 
   Note I installed most with sboinstall <PKG-NAME>, the version number is the
   version I installed. I did my installation IN THIS ORDER.
    2.1 - RapidJSON --> version 1.1.0
    2.2 - utfcpp --> version 2012.02.10
    2.3 - Sparsehash --> version 2.0.3
    2.4 - proj --> version 6.2.1
    2.5 - cppcheck --> version 1.76
    2.6 - geos --> version 3.8.0 - required for gdal.
    2.7 - gdal --> version 3.0.4 :: I downloaded SlackBuild from SlackBuild.org
                   and source then manually built and installed.
                   
3) Provided by yours truly as SlackBuild scripts: found with this package.
    3.1 - protozero --> version 1.7.0
    3.2 - Libosmium --> version 2.15.6
    
4) Pandoc package is optional and will build man pages if detected by cmake.
   You can find osmium manual at: (https://osmcode.org/osmium-tool/manual.html).
   You can (should) download the manual if you do not install pandoc. 
   I used an old script I found on www.linuxquestions.org slackware
   forum written by "LQ Guru dugan"; see the thread at:
     "https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/slackware-14/
      installing-pandoc-on-current-x86_64-the-easy-way-4175620166/"
   (above url is one line broken into 2; combine into ONE line please)
   and the source mentioned in the thread is: "https://pandoc.org/installing.html"
   The file I downloaded was: "pandoc-2.11-linux-amd64.tar.gz" 
   So change the version number and fix file name to match whatever file you 
   download and then install the package.
   
Summary:
  Assuming you are on current (like me); install the packages in the listed order
in step 2 above, then build and install the two packages in step 3. Now you are
ready to build and install the osmium-tool package.

What is next:
  Build, install and configure OpenStreepMap Overpass server on local machine.
  
Enjoy :)
